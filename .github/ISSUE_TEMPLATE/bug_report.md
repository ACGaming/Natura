This is the repository of Natura Legacy exclusively for 1.12.2 and is not affiliated with the original mod, other forks, or other unofficial ports of Natura. Please do not report any bugs originating from other forks or other unofficial ports of Natura, they will immediately be closed and marked as invalid.

Make sure that the bug you are reporting happens on the LATEST version of the mod, especially if you are playing on a modpack that hasn't been updated in awhile. It is likely that the bug you are reporting has already been fixed and will count as an invalid issue.
